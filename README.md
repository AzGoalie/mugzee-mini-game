# Mine Dodging Mini Game

My guild in World of Warcraft was stuck on Mug'Zee due to lack of situational awareness and running into mines.

I had an idea to make a joke game that would help us 'practice' dodging mines. It turned out to be a lot more fun than anticipated.

Dodge the mines coming from the Boss and touch the red circles to prevent them from exploding with WASD. You can press the button for your 'rotation' in the right order to gain a score multiplier.
